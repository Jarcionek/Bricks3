Jewel Quest Java game in Swing.

IMPORTANT: In some (even newest) versions of JVM, SwingWorker.class I used doesn't work correctly and the game becomes unplayable. If no brick is selected and pressing left mouse button on a brick doesn't make it selected, then the game doesn't work with your version of JVM.
